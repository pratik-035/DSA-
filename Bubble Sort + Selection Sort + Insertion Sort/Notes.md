Note that these sorting techniques are not used in production level code
since the time complexity of these sorting is really bad .

But these sorting techniques you should know becuase in interviews these sorting algorithms can be asked. 

Time Complexity : O(n^2)


Also note that for time complexity :
suggest you to do matehmatics 
AP and GP
