Note that these sorting techniques are not used in production level code
since the time complexity of these sorting is really bad .

But these sorting techniques you should know becuase in interviews these sorting algorithms can be asked. 

Time Complexity : O(n^2)


Also note that for time complexity :
suggest you to do matehmatics 
AP and GP

Bubble Sort : Bubble Sort compares <u>each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order</u>. This process repeast until the array is sorted .

Example : Imagine you have a line of people and you want ti arrange them in order of height. You go from left to right, comparing each person with the next one. If the person on the left is taller, you ask them to swap. You repeat this process again and again until nobody needs to swap - that's Bubble Sort 

<u>Difference</u>

Process : Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements 
Best Time Complexity : O(n) (already sorted) 
Worst Time : O(n^2)
Space Complexity : O(1)

<u>When to use ? </u>
Use bubble sort if you want something easy to understand or teach. 

Selection Sort : 



Insertion Sort :
